The app is great, it has a simple, easy-to-use interface and doesn't suffer from lag issues like other shopping apps. The reason I am choosing to give eBay 4/5 stars is due to the introduction of \"AI\". When creating a listing, users are prompted to have AI make a description. Many sellers do this and it often leads to key details about products being missing due to AI.",

Also way too many \"sponsored\" results in product searches. I have to apply a bunch of filters to get the results that are relevant.",

It's nearly impossible to reach 100% completion, and even getting close to 95% seems futile due to the platform's unfair settings. To win prizes, you're often required to refer hundreds of friends, which is unrealistic. Given the low prize value and excessively challenging game levels, I advise against wasting time and sharing with friends. Instead, consider saving that time and money (around 40-50 rupees Daily) to purchase your desire",

It took over 60 days to be refunded back. I'm 🤬! However I decided to take a chance on Temu and Shop. I'm glad I Did❣️ They've got great items, best retail prices, and customer service has been awesome 💯❣️ I'm able to shop anyplace and know that Temu backs up their promises, you don't like whatever purchased return for refund or credit. 🥰LOVE ♥️",
